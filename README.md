# smart-contracts
The last stop for smart contracts. 
## Motivation for the repo
I am fond of two things: MS Dhoni and learning new techs. I don not need a push to watch matches of MS Dhoni but sometimes I do need a little push to start the new technology. I don't think there has been any developer whose social media was not blown away by the wave of Web3, and suddenly everyone started talking about crypto, metaverse, smart contracts and what not. I too was. More precisely I too am. So I thought of takingthe  first step towards Web3 and start writing SMART CONTRACTS which will serve as a template for any smart contract based project.

And by the way, what was the 'push' this time? Well, I had to write smart contracts for a stealth mode internship project.
